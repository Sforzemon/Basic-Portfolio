                    Michael has always been passionate about creating. From a young age he would write stories or make music.  It was the concept of starting with nothing and having something tangible afterwards was endlessly fascinating to him and drove him to continue to make whatever he could, song or story.

                    Having grown up in a household filled with electronics, Michael was well-aware of their use but never delved too deeply into them. And, when asked what he would study as he got older, he would exclaim to anyone that would listen, “Not computers, that’s for sure, I hate those things.”

                    He, instead, continued to pursue his fascination with music, and when it came time to go to college, that was what he decided to do.  Study music.  He studied composition and kept his creative outlets full brimming.  However, a degree in music, without being combined with a certification in teaching is not a very useful means to getting a new job, and so Michael turned towards his old nemesis, computers.

                    Luckily, while growing up traversing jungles of networking cables and skirting around the looming towers or bitcoin miners he had picked up a fair amount of knowledge about the workings of these devices. One would assume this happened via osmosis. He was fortunate enough to obtain a position doing IT for a school district.  Unfortunately, this position doesn’t carry with it the level of creativity that he yearns for. But after doing a fair amount of research, it seems that web/software development does.

                    And so, with the wonderful sense of irony that is his life, a new adventure begins.
