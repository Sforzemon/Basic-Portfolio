            <p>Michael grew up in a small town in New Mexico. There, under the watchful eye of his parents, he denounced anything ever having to do with technology.  "My dad works with computer," he would wail into the night. "No way on Earth I am going to be doing that too"  He stayed true to his word and when given the choice of major in college he did not choose computers.</p>
            <p>Instead, Michael chose to pursue a degree is Music.  He studied composition and quickly became enamored with creating.  The concept of taking nothing and building up a product was fascinating to him.</p>
            <p>As time passed, Michael reached out to other outlets for creativity as well.  Then computers came back into the fold.  With the proper knowledge he could again create things from nothing. And so a new venture began.</p>
